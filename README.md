# Console Student Logbook 

A console application that simulates a student's logbook. 

## How it works

It has two modes, working in memory and on file.
At the start, you need to enter a name and select a mode.
If you have chosen the file mode, the program will create a text file with the given name in which grades will be saved, if one does not exist. The memory mode works only until the application is closed.



## What we can do

- Add a grade (1-6, including +/-)
- Delete a grade
- View grades
- Display statistics (average, lowest, highest, letter grade from average A>4.5, B>3.9, C>3, D<3)
- Change the name
